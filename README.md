# Movies-ETL

This project will create varous automated functions that takes in raw uncleaned data, from Wikipedia, Kaggle metadata and the MovieLens rating data.
Then it will perform ETL procedures (Extract, Transform, Load) to extract data from web, import CSV and Json files and subsequently performs various data cleaning techniques to transform the data from dirty to clean. final step will be loading the data into an existing PostgreSQL database.
##Methods of Procedure

1) write an ETL function to read three large data files,
2) extract and transform the Wikipedia data,
3) extract and transform the Kaggle and rating data,
